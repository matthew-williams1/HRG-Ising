# HRG-Ising

This repository is for the code written by the Hernandez Research Group. 
Our research project is to create a machine learning algorithm that can 
predict the magnetic field acitng on an Ising model based solely on the 
cooling history of this Ising model. 

As of right now, we have a functional and well optimized method for 
calculating the energy of an NxN randomly generated lattice with 
periodic boundary condtitions. The next step is to research and 
implement an algorithm that uses a version of the the Monte Carlo method
to advance the simulation of the Ising model.
